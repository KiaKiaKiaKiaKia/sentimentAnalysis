This is an NLP sentiment analysis AI I developed
as part of my AI module in my third year of uni.

The program cleans, splits, preprocesses, vectorises, 
conducts a short EDA, models, evaluates the model and 
has a short demonstration on unseen reviews. This 
repository includes a critical analysis of the 
performance of this program. The dataset used was 
obtained at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews 
(Accessed on: 6 January 2025)

What I learnt:
- Development process for AI
- How to use lots of new libraries (e.g. Matplotlib for plotting graphs)
- How to clean and process data and the importance of it
- How to conduct EDA and the importance of it
- How to evaluate the performance of an AI

Improvements:
- improve the performance of the AI (start with a more balanced dataset)
- Add a GUI
